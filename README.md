# michigan-endangered-species

This dynamic visualization allows the user to explore Michigan's threated & endangered species data in a variety of ways. It was built using D3.js, responsive table from bl.ocks.org for mobile, and DataTables (datatables.net).

The data in this web app was obtained from the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) on April 10, 2018. Special thanks go to Rebecca Rogers from MNFI.

This visualization was completed during the spring of 2018 as part of UW-Madison's Masters in GIS and Web Map Programming.
